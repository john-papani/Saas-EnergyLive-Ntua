This folder hosts the necessary folders and files that define the parameters of stress (load) testing of our application. For this purpose, we use Apache jMeter and we test the performace of all endpoints that are implemented in ATL, AGT and USERS microservices. The purpose of stress testing is to determine the effectiveness of our app when dealing with excessive load and generally unfavorable conditions.
